Part 1: WASD to move. Movement is restricted to central terrain.

Part 2: WASD to move. Up and down arrows rotate velocity by z. Press M to switch into static mode, where the chair boy can't
	be controlled and can be "eaten" by the alien chessbeast in its natual habitat.
	The controls are indeed strange, you're not imagining it. They're a little hard to get used to, but they met and
	still meet the requirements of the project they were introduced in. Getting them to feel "right" would take a while.

Part 3 / 4: Controls are displayed in GUI. Camera speed can be adjusted in the editor.

Part 5: Ship moves to shoot asteroids that would hit / come close to hitting it. The "danger" threshold can be adjusted in the
	editor, by clicking on the "ship" trigger.

Part 6: Peace sign made by me in GIMP. The .xcf is contained with the PNG in the textures folder.

Part 7: No extra controls. Watch the boy attempt to make friends with a local chessbeast by singing the song of its people.

The extraterrestrial loves it! Look at how excited(?) it is!
